    <h1>My data</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        My first dataset is from data.gov and is a breakdown of hate crimes in the US
        in the year 2015. There is also the same dataset for years all the way back to 2004.
        This is published by the FBI and serves the full country. For eaach year it has an
        excel sheet for a breakdown by which group was targeted, where these atacks took place,
        and much more.

        My second dataset is from the city of Austin in texas, and it shows the hate crimes
        for each month in 2018. It also has data for what race for offender and location
        of offense.
